# Library

This is the backend application of the Library project, homework for the subject Electronic and Mobile Commerce. The main idea is to help the librarians do their job more easily by automating the whole process.

The librarian can add books to the system(new books), delete books(old/not in good condition),edit books(new editions), get/return a copy from a book.

This is a Spring Boot Application that uses H2 database management system.
